# claude-particles
I wanted to show Acke how good claude ai is, and asked it to "make a cool interactive css js application". I put the html/js/css in github and deplloyed it in vercel for free. Acke asked for more colors and curves, claude delivered, I updated the github repo and the app udpated. We were joking around saying "when we were young we had ski free and we loved it", so of course I asked claude to make ski free as a js web app, and it is not under www.ekte.tools/ski
